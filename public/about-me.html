<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Juliya — a future Full-Stack Developer who genuinely loves learning and creating.
I started my journey with Python, and now I’m exploring Django, SQL, Git, HTML/CSS, and front-end technologies.
I enjoy building real projects step by step, from small console programs to full web applications.</p>

<p>My goal is to develop beautiful, functional websites and applications, grow professionally, and eventually work as a freelance or full-time developer.</p>

<p>I believe in consistency, curiosity, and the power of small daily steps.</p>
